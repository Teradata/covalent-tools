# covalent-e2e-coverage

> Code coverage proxy


## Overview

Code Coverage Proxy built off of `was-tested` and `remap-istanbul`.  The `was-tested` code coverage proxy was built for vanilla javascript source files.  Covalent-e2e-coverage uses the `remap-istanbul` package to utilize the source map files and to instrument coverage when using Typescript files as well.

The [remap-istanbul](https://github.com/SitePen/remap-istanbul) github repository.

The [was-tested](https://github.com/bahmutov/was-tested) github repository.

### Usage

To instrument e2e coverage for a Typescript project do the following:

* Clone this repository
* Startup the covalent-e2e-coverage proxy in this repo by running `npm run start`
* Checkout another repo that has e2e tests in it
* Edit the package.json in the other repo to run in production mode, but with source maps turned on:
```
"scripts": {
"serve:prod": "node --max_old_space_size=5048 ./node_modules/.bin/ng serve --aot --prod --sourcemap=true --build-optimizer --proxy-config proxy.conf.json",
...
}
```
* Start up the above repo with e2e tests in it with the command `npm run serve:prod`
* Edit the package.json of the repo that has the e2e tests in it to point to the covalent-e2e-coverage proxy instead (default runs on port 5050):
```
"scripts": {
"e2e": "ng e2e -pc proxy.conf.json --no-serve --base-href=http://localhost:5050",
...
}
```
* Run the e2e tests from above with the command, `npm run e2e`
* After completed either hit the genreport endpoint: http://localhost:5050/__genreport
or 
* Run the npm script to generate the report: `npm run genreport`
* In the browser go to: http://localhost:5050/__report/
* See Coverage Report
